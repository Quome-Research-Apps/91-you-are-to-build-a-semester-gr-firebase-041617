## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Very light cyan background (#EBF5FB converted to RGB) to provide a clean, non-distracting backdrop. HSL=(203, 50, 95)
- Accent color: Blue (#4878B6 converted to RGB), to draw attention to interactive elements. HSL=(223, 45, 49)
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (geometric sans-serif) for headlines, 'PT Sans' (humanist sans-serif) for body text.
- Simple, outline-style icons for course management and assignment types.
- Clean and structured layout with clear visual hierarchy for easy navigation.
- Subtle transitions and animations when adding or updating courses/assignments to provide visual feedback.
